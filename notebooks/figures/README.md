- areas.svg: Just as a reference for the funtional role of each area.

- logFLN.eps: Figure with the log. of connectivity (Fraction of Labeled Neurons, FLN). The connectivity is assimetric, both axis represent the cortical areas, the x-axis show the sending areas and the y-axis the receiving areas.

- Distances.eps: The wiring distances between the cortical areas, the axis show each cortical area but since it is a distance matrix, it is symetric.

- Hierarchy.eps: The hirarchy value of each cortical area in the model/dataset.

- circuitGBA.pdf: Representation of the local circuit (two local circuits in this cartoon) of the network, and how excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) interconnects. Also showing the difference in connection strengths (line tickness).

- fr_fixation_weakGBA.eps: Firing rate time-series (x-axis) for each cortical area (y-axis). Averaged over fixation trials (no stimulus in V1) and weak GBA .

- fr_fixation_strongGBA.eps: Firing rate time-series (x-axis) for each cortical area (y-axis). Averaged over fixation trials (no stimulus in V1) and strong GBA.

- fr_task_weakGBA.eps: Firing rate time-series (x-axis) for each cortical area (y-axis). Averaged over task trials (stimulus in V1) and weak GBA.

- fr_task_strongGBA.eps: Firing rate time-series (x-axis) for each cortical area (y-axis). Averaged over task trials (stimulus in V1) and strong GBA.

- synergy_space_time_weak.eps: Synergy time-series (x-axis) of all areas with V1 (y-axis) and stimulus presence, for the weak GBA condition.

- synergy_space_time_strong.eps: Synergy time-series (x-axis) of all areas with V1 (y-axis) and stimulus presence, for the strong GBA condition.

- synergy_time_average.svg: This plot shows the time-averaged synergy for each region (with V1) for weak (red) and strong (blue) GBA.

- AIS_space_time_weak.eps: Active information-storage time-series (x-axis) for each cortical area (y-axis) and the weak GBA condition.

- AIS_space_time_strong.eps: Active information-storage time-series (x-axis) for each cortical area (y-axis) and the strong GBA condition.

- AIS_time_averaged.svg: Active information storage averaged over time for each cortical area for weak (red) and strong (blue) GBA.
