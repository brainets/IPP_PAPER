This package contains the following C++ files:

nmring.h/.cpp: 		main model, integration, and stimulus-related code.
util.h/.cpp:   	    	utility macros and file system, averaging, PNG and numpy array writing methods.
threadpool.h/.cpp:   	thread pool to run the model in a MT environment.
oneRing_model.cpp:	main driver program for a single ring.
fb2rings_model.cpp:	main driver program for two rings with feed-forward and -backward couplings.
ff3rings_model.cpp	main driver program for three rings with feed-forward coupling.
// ++++++++++++++++++ Details +++++++++++++++++++++++++
Compile the code for all three models by typing "make2, or for one of the three driver by "make oneRing_model",
for example. To test functionality, comment in the lines at the beginning of each main function marked with
"// minitest of functionality" (and comment out the lines marked with "// the real thing:") and compile.

Clean compiled code by typing "make clean", this will not remove result directories.
Generate a package by typing "make tar", this will generate an archive in subdirectory keller/.
